# COMP494-MINI-PROJECT-2
This project generates a Voronoi diagram using Fortune's algorithm. 
The implementation includes classes for points, events, arcs, segments, 
and a priority queue. Additionally, a simple graphical user interface (GUI) is 
provided using the `tkinter` library for visualizing the Voronoi diagram 
interactively.

## Usage

1. **Manually Add Points:**
   - Double-click on the canvas to add points manually.
  
2. **Calculate Voronoi Diagram:**
   - Click the "Calculate" button to compute the Voronoi diagram based on the input points.

3. **Visualize Steps:**
   - Click the "Next" button to visualize each step of the algorithm.

4. **Clear Canvas:**
   - Click the "Clear" button to reset the canvas and add new points.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShengyuanWang/COMP494-MINI-PROJECT-2.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Voroni
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 test.py
   ```
